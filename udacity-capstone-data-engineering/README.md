## Project Summary

The project explores US immigration data alongside US city demographics and world temperature data. The data is explored, then aggregated to build an ETL pipeline inside the notebook. The notebook format was chosen to allow intituative investigation of the data, while still building up the ETL model.

The project follows the follow steps:

- Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
- Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
- Step 3: Define the Data Model
- Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
- Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

## Data

This project will use data from multiple sources and create both fact and dimension tables to allow the user to query for links between destination of travel and the temperature of the travel destination.

The following datasets are used in the project:

- I94 Immigration Data: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office and includes the contents of the i94 form on entry to the united states. A data dictionary is included in the workspace. It is provided in SAS7BDAT format which is a binary database storage format.
- World Temperature Data: This dataset comes from Kaggle and includes the temperatures of various cities in the world fomr 1743 to 2013. The dataset can be found here.
Now lets take
